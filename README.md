We placed 6 electrodes around the eyes
The left two are reference and grounds, it's better to ignore them.
The channel information is as follows:
Above the Right Eye:    ch_ru = 6;
Below the Right Eye:    ch_rd = 7;
Above the Left Eye:      ch_lu = 4;
Below the Left Eye:      ch_ld = 5;
To the Left of the Left Eye    ch_l = 1;
To the Right of the Right Eye    ch_r = 3;
